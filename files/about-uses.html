			<h4 class="service-heading">Discoveries</h4>
			<p class="text-muted">
			While discoveries are typically described in journals or meetings where the audience
			is familiar with the subject. When writing a story for a broader audience try to find 
			a personal connection for the discovery, something most people can relate to. 
			Also try minimizing jargon, speaking vividly and conversationally.

			<h4 class="service-heading">Events</h4>
			<p class="text-muted">
			Events can teach us about victories and tragedies, about overcoming challenges or insurmountable hardships.

			Try to use engaging words to make your story more interesting.

			<p class="text-muted">
			A project is a story that is growing organically. It may start with an idea or a question and over time 
			blossom into a complete story. Whether the story is leading to a discovery or documenting an event as it unfolds, 
			use the same engaging methods you would use if the full story was already known.

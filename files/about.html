		<b>Everything has a story.</b><br />
		Whether it's interesting discovories, things you've done, or things you plan to do, you can tell the story with a storyboard.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Storyboard app is designed to use todayâ€™s technologies to tell 
		stories that are rich multi-media experiences, blending text, 
		animations, movies and infographics. The Storyboard app presents a set 
		of cards that contain representative images of an event with associated 
		notes or instructions. The cards are arranged in a timeline that allow 
		a user to experience a discovery or event in the same way it occurred. 
		Each card can link to a more detailed source such as a publication, the 
		data that was collected or items derived from the research (like movies 
		or animations). A storyboard can be used to make science discovery more 
		accessible to people by presenting events in an easy to follow layout. A 
		storyboard can also help to teach the scientific method, by following 
		the experiences of a researcher as they investigate a phenomenon or try 
		to understand a new set of observations.
